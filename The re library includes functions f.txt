The re library includes functions for regular expressions:

- re.search("xxx", "yyy"): search the string "yyy" for an instance of "xxx"
- re.match(): same as re.search but it starts at the beginning of the string and can't find matches that start in the middle or a string


The nltk natural language toolkit library includes tokenization functions:

- sent_tokenize: tokenize a document into sentences
- regexp_tokenize: tokenize a string or document based on a regular expression pattern
